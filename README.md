### Requirements
 - You need Docker and docker-compose installed on your machine
 - In the source directory run `docker-compose build` to build the image
 - Then `docker-compose up` to run the containers
 - Paste in the API token in the `container.env` file
 - To a `GET` request to `localhost:8080/adverts` to get all adverts *Note: Note the best approach to trigger this action, but will do for a prototype*
